Tool for correcting [Futureal](https://github.com/GREAT-DNG/Futureal) settings and saves files.

File problems can occur when updating the game. In this case, it is recommended to use this tool.

## Usage

### Saves
If the game crashes when loading a level after updating the game, there is a chance that the problem is with incorrect save files. Try to restore the file first:
1. Go to the Saves tab.
2. Enter in the input field the number of the level that cannot be loaded. Please note that the numbering of levels starts from zero. For example, to fix a problem with the first level, enter zero.
3. Click the Check button to verify that the save file is present and that it is incorrect.
4. If a list of incorrect values is displayed, you can try to fix it.
5. Click the Fix button to fix the save file.

### Settings
The game itself provides for re-creation and correction of settings, but if this does not work, follow these steps to restore:
1. Go to Settings tab.
2. Click the Check button to verify that the settings file is present and that it is incorrect.
3. If a list of incorrect values is displayed or a message about the absence of a file, you can try to fix it.
4. Set the necessary settings using the switches on the left side.
5. Click the Fix button to fix the settings file.

### Deleting
If none of the above helps, you can try removal as a last resort. When deleting save files, remember to start from scratch. You can also clear the logs to free up space.
